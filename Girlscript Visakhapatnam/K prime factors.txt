Yummy is preparing a topic called prime factors. The preparation is getting too boring for her liking. To make it interesting, she herself assaigned a task.

Task is to Count K-Primes. A number is a k-prime if it has exactly k distinct prime factors. The Task is quite simple. She will select three numbers A, B & K randomly. She needs to find number of K-prime numbers between A & B (both inclusive). She play this game T times.

Help Yummy to find the count

Input Format

First line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases, i.e the number of times she play. Each test case is described in a single line containing the three numbers A,B & K.

Constraints

1<=T<=10000

2<=A<=B<=100000

1<=K<=5

Output Format

For each test case , print the number of k-primes between A & B in a new line.

In first test case 2-number of prime factors(n) is 1 i.e 2 and n is equal K
3-number of prime factors(n) is 1 i.e 3 and n is equal K
4-number of prime factors(n) is 1 i.e 2 and n is equal K
5-number of prime factors(n) is 1 i.e 5 and n is equal K
There are 4 numbers which satisfies the condition so is the answer
